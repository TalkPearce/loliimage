	<h2>Champion Picks</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Diana</h3>
	<p>This is the most meta-changing pick I have, plus I am the most experienced on the champion.  Usually the build is to go striaght Ap carry but recently I've been swapping out the gnashors tooth with a Guardian angel because you get as much basic attack damage but you also get armour and a powerful revive every five minuets.  This can change the outcome of many early-game fights and is as strong as a Zhonha's Hourglass in many cases.</p>

	<h3>Volibear</h3>
	<br>
	<p>The Volibear runes are exactly what's needed to bolster his macho fighting style.  The build is carry style, but unfortunately is not working due to the fact you need 3 items and will only work if i snowball into a scaling position.  This seems too ambitious as a regular carry and we should be looking to jungle carry the early game.  He might be suitable as a carry top laner since I do not need to be battle heavy and i can control waves easily with the passive <strong>Lightning Strikes</strong></p>

	<br>
	<h3>K'Sante</h3>
	<p>K'Sante feels like a tricky top pick but I have been impressed with performances of other players using this champion.  The best idea is to get the rhythm of his play-style and to start using him as a juggernaught.  Hopefully this includes being as unkillable as on the champion Sett.</p>
